Problem 4
=========
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Of course brute force on this doesn't take very long. I wanted to try me hand at reducing the complexity, and it got kind of messy.
